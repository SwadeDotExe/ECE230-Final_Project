  ## Description
  This repository is my ECE230 (Embedded Systems) capstone project that won the award for "Best Project" that quarter. We used the Texas Instruments MSP432 development board as the microcontroller in our system, and interfaced with various sensors and periphrials to meet the requirements of the project. Some of the sensors are:
  * Voltage reading on the battery
  * Current shunt for amp draw
  * Sonar sensor for distance
  * Wheel speed sensor
  
  This write-up is going to be a little different than what I do for personal project, simply because it is an academic project that had to meet certain requirements.

  ## Proposal
  ### General Requirements
  We are going to create a remote controlled car that runs off of the MSP432P111 microcontroller with a variety of sensors and output devices. The bulk of the project will be interfacing the microcontroller with the drive system of the car, which will most likely be purchased secondhand and retrofitted for our needs. The car we purchase (or create) will need to be big enough to encase the MSP and carry the battery pack and extra peripherals we decide to include, and be able to support the weight of all these devices. We plan to control the car through a remote terminal connected via bluetooth that transmits keyboard commands to the vehicle, and receive metrics about the carâ€™s status.
  
  ### Specifications
  * 2 (or 4) drive wheels to move the car
  * Integrated battery pack to power the vehicle
  * Working headlights and possibly interior lighting
  * Accelerometer on vehicle that feeds metrics back to terminal
  * ESP32-CAM module to send live video feed to computer
