## Basic Overview
For the arcade game project, we made a classic arcade style Bomb Jack game. Using what we learned in CSSE220 and in some cases going beyond what was taught in class, we designed a game based on the 1984 classic aracade game Bomb Jack using Java.

## A Video Playthrough of the Game Can Be Found Here:

## Essential Features:
- Bomb Jack who moves left, right and up with arrow keys, stands on platforms, falls (due to gravity), and collects cherry bombs, and starts out with 4 number of lives
- Two types of Aliens: initial aliens just move back and forth on the platforms.
- When the hero and an alien collide, the hero dies and loses a life.
- There are cherry bombs placed at various locations on a level, and are picked by the hero when he collides with them. Each time a bomb is collected, the hero scores points.
- If the hero collects all the bombs on a level, then the player moves on to the next level.
- Each level has its own configuration of bombs, aliens, platforms.
- When the hero loses all 4 lives then the game is over.
- The game loada each level from a pre-created text-based data file.
- The game displays the current score and the number of lives the hero currently has.
- Includes **U** (up) and **D** (down) keystrokes to go the next level or go back a level.

## Extra Features:
- The hero has shooting capability (shoot little mario bullets), and if an alien is hit by the heroâ€™s bullet, then the alien is destroyed and disappears from the screen and the hero scores points. [Keystrokes: **W** (to shoot to left of hero) and **E** (to shoot to right of hero)

- There is a second type of alien that is designed to track the hero and move towards him depending on his location in relation to the alien.

- Boss Level: Consists of a giant tracking alien. Requires a bunch of bullets to kill the alien, and you have to beat the alien in order to win the game.
